## GitHub

- To create a local repository "git remote add origin url"
- To push into repo use git push origin master

- To goTo some branch we use "git checkout Branch_Name"
- To merge branch into main branch use "git merge branch_name"
- To clone a project "git clone project_git_url"
- To fetch all the commits from the other main branch we use
- git fetch --all --prune or git pull upstream main
- Let say you have 5 commits in sub branch and you want to merge them to main branch
- if you want to merge all the commits of sub as one commit into main we use
- git rebase -i main_branch_commit_hash_code
- And we can select which can be pick and which can be sqash
- Diff b/w fetch and pull: we can use pull to get code from github to local at the same time we can use fetch
  also but along with fetch we have to use merge command also
- To Undo the changes in working area use git checkout file_Name -- Dangerous Command
- To Undo the changes in staging area use git reset file_Name -- Dangerous Command
